# Phase 0 baseline and calibration evidence

raw-results.json and BASELINE.md are the original full-profile observation.
They remain useful as historical evidence, but their WSL2 environment means
they are not the Phase 1 variance reference.

The native-Linux reference is retained under
benchmarks/phase0/calibration/native-linux-2026-08-27. Its CALIBRATION.md and
aggregate.json describe seven independent full-profile processes and link every
individual raw run.

Generate a new reference only from a clean worktree on a stable native-Linux
host or VM:

~~~bash
tools/run_phase0_calibration.sh benchmarks/phase0/calibration/native-linux-YYYY-MM-DD
~~~

The command refuses WSL and detected containers, requires a fresh output
directory, records source/environment provenance before and after every run,
and invokes tools/run_phase0_baselines.sh full seven times. Each invocation
still validates contracts and fixtures and still treats all containment,
topology, capacity, reclamation, and resource checks as pass/fail.

The archive contains:

- runs/run-NN/raw-results.json and runs/run-NN/BASELINE.md for every full
  profile;
- per-run execution status and before/after host observations, including
  virtualization, allocator, CPU frequency/power policy where observable, and
  background-load notes;
- aggregate.json with per-metric sample count, run count, minimum, median,
  maximum, MAD, CV, run-level outliers, and advisory comparison bands;
- CALIBRATION.md, the concise human-readable reference.

The evidence is observational. Its comparison bands are Phase 1
regression-detection aids, not production SLOs, capacity guarantees, or
cross-machine claims.
